DBC Final Project


WORKFLOW for core team

We are going to do versions.
Instead of mvp, we have version 0.0.1.

This should have the following:

splash page with functioning form
  -whats your name?
  -what is your phone number?
  -what do you love?


1 event module that works smoothly.

This event module is just whatever we get done and added and merged to the repo first.

Who's will be first? A little healthy competion never hurt anyone.

When the second event module gets added, we have version 0.0.2.

This will be our basic workflow. Pick either a feature on the splash page or end page.

We should all be working toward the completion of a specific module that is completable by Sunday or sooner.

I would like each of us to have something added by then, in other words, by Sunday at midnight
we should push version 0.0.5 with!!!!! Tony, if you get blocked on something like Oauth and need more time, thats totally ok!
Everyone else, if you are blocked please communicate with the rest of the team sooner rather than later.


HOW TO MAKE A SUCCESSFUL PULL REQUEST

-do not leave any variables that would pollute the global namespace.
-if your script includes any dependancies (besides jQuery) delete those libraries in your .done function
